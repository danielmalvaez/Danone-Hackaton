# Danone Hackaton ðŸ’»

This repository stores the files needed for the Danone Hackaton. The data provided by Danone is:

* train_products.json
* test_products.json

In this project I decided to solve this challenge by using Google Colab, mainly because of the provided free GPU that is really useful while training machine learning or deep learning models that require a huge computation power. Additionally, working in Google Colab allowed us to work in Jupyter Notebooks which makes easier to follow and understand the code.

> As you might have noticed, there are two prediction files. But just the correct or the one I want to deliver is the one that corresponds with the proper name which is **predictions.json**


In the other hand, the following files are the notebook, data profiling, prediction of the xgboost classifier and the prediction of the neural network respectively:

* Hackaton\_Danone\_Classification.ipynb
* report.html
* predictions.json
* predictions_nn.jason
