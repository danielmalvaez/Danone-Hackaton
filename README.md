# Danone Hackaton ðŸ’»

This repository stores the files needed for the Danone Hackaton. The data provided by Danone is:

* train_products.json
* test_products.json

The tool we will use to solve this challenge will be Google Colab due to is provided GPU for free so that we can run the training a predicting functions faster. Additionally, working in Google Colab allows you to work in Jupyter Notebooks which makes it easier to read and follow the code.

In the other hand, the following files are the notebook, data profiling, prediction of the xgboost classifier and the prediction of the neural network respectively:

* Hackaton\_Danone\_Classification.ipynb
* report.html
* predictions.json
* predictions_nn.jason
